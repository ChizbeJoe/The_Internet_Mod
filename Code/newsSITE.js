In fact, their new arcade game <i>Dinkey King</i> has reached an impressive milestone: <b>over 60,000 machines have been sold!</b><br><br>Repeatedly trying to beat their high-score, many are glued to screen. To explore this love for the game, we asked certain players what they thought and received various responses:<br>- "I used to love the arcade game Tac-Man, and while <i>Dinkey King</i> is like Tac-Man, it offers a little more. You just run and hide in Tac-Man, but in <i>Dinkey King</i> it is not just about the high score; there is a goal: save the princess!"<br>- "I guess I just like the motions more than other games: run, jump, stop, RUN! Its a simple way to relax but still engaging."<br>- "Plain and simple, I love monkeys; ever since I saw King Kong, I have loved monkeys. <i>Dinkey King</i> gets that side of me, haha!"<br><br> A certain money maker, <i>Dinkey King</i> paves the way for the future of Ninvento.',

Consumers Prefer the Lower Price</h2><br>With a selling price of just $595, the <i>G64</i> is a computer that does not exclusively cater to the rich; many middle-class families are able to buy and use the <i>G64</i>. <b>Greater availability</b> is a signifcant reason the <i>G64</i> thrives, but it's certainly not the only reason.<br><br><h2>2. The <i>G64</i>'s Hardware</h2><br>Compared to other computers, the <i>G64</i> allows for easy configuration of hardware. With various motherboard ports, a cartridge port is left wide-open for any kind of use. Experts even say that this might spell the end of competing hardware manufacturers.<br><br>Right now, Godovore is clearly leading with around 30% of the computer marketshare.
